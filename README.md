# Encapsulation in Python

## Introduction
Encapsulation is an OOP concept that restricts direct access to the internal data of an object and bundles the data with methods that operate on it. It helps in data hiding and maintaining control over the data.

## Key Concepts
### Access Specifiers ->
- **Public Members**  
- **Protected Members** (`_single_underscore`)  
- **Private Members** (`__double_underscore`)  

## Topics to Learn
- Creating and accessing public, protected, and private variables  
- Using getter and setter methods  
- Controlling access to class data using encapsulation
